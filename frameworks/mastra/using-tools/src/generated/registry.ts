 * This object is auto-generated from your agent files during build.
 * Each agent has corresponding Input, Output, and Runner types exported above.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { AgentDefinitions, SessionBasicInput } from './generated/registry';
 * 
 * // Access agent definition
 * const agent = AgentDefinitions.sessionBasic;
 * 
 * // Use typed schema types
 * const input: SessionBasicInput = { ... };
 * const result = await agent.run(input);
 * ```
